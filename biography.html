    <h2>AS SHE <I>ROSE</I></h2>
    <p> Chappell Roan’s professional journey began in 2017 when she signed with Atlantic Records and released her debut single, Good Hurt. Despite early success, her first extended play, School Nights, did not achieve significant commercial recognition, leading to her departure from the label.However, this setback became a turning point in her career. After moving to Los Angeles, Roan refined her sound, embracing a more theatrical and expressive pop style that reflected her artistic identity. Her breakthrough came in 2020 with the release of Pink Pony Club, which was celebrated as a queer anthem and marked her emergence as a bold new voice in pop music. In 2023, she released her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, a critically acclaimed work that solidified her status as one of pop’s most original and dynamic rising artists. </p>
